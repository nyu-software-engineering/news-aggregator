## End-user Observation
### Persona 1: College Student
Todd Johnson is a college freshman at New York University. He wants to stay up to date with the latest global news and be cognizant of what is going on outside of the campus bubble. He feels it extremely important to be well-versed in political knowledge and current news in order to be able to maintain mature conversations/debates with his peers. His primary medium of news consumption is an iPhone, and he reaches for the NYT, WSJ, and Apple News apps. An avid sports fan, Todd prefers to use the ESPN app for all sports news.

**Pain Points**
* There is so much content that is published, making it increasingly difficult to sift through the articles and identify what is truly worth reading. For instance, a lot of headlines have to do with Trump this, Trump that – but it's difficult to determine which stories are truly relevant and unbiased?
* Once a key article is found, it is often multiple paragraphs long and takes a long time to read and absorb; writing is often dry and overly didactic, resulting in difficult-to-follow news pieces whose numerous details obfuscate the main topic of the headline.
	* During the time spent reading a long news story, Todd may inevitably become distracted by a notification popup on his phone.
* The “filter” functionality in Apple News still yields a seemingly endless stream of content, much of which is irrelevant to Todd. This ranges from pop culture content to cooking recipes.

**Key Features to Solve Pain Points**
* Algorithms could identify the trending topics across a variety of news sources and generate a “top 5” list of trending news in multiple categories specifically selected by the user, such as politics, global news, and domestic US news. 
* The “top 5” headlines lists would be displayed in a compact form on a distraction-less, modern GUI, such that the user has can easily view data at a glance without having to scroll or click multiple buttons.
* An algorithm that traverses the selected “top 5” articles and generates a short (3-5 bullets) descriptive blurb summarizing the content of each target article.
